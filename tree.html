            Deforestation is the clearing, destroying, or otherwise removal of trees through deliberate, natural or accidental means. It can occur in any area densely populated by trees and other plant life, but the majority of it is currently happening in the Amazon rainforest.
            The loss of trees and other vegetation can cause climate change, desertification, soil erosion, fewer crops, flooding, increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and a host of problems for indigenous people.
            Deforestation occurs for a number of reasons, including: farming, mostly cattle due to its quick turn around; and logging, for materials and development. It has been happening for thousands of years, arguably since man began converting from hunter/gatherer to agricultural based societies, and required larger, unobstructed tracks of land to accommodate cattle, crops, and housing. 
            It was only after the onset of the modern era that it became an epidemic.

    <h2>Deforestation Solution</h2>
    <div class="plastic-article">
        <ul class="plastic-para-article">
            <li>1.Clear cutting of forests must be banned. 
                This will curb total depletion of the forest cover. It is a practical solution and is very feasible.
            </li>
            <li>2.The best solution to deforestation is to curb the felling of trees, by employing a series of rules and laws to govern it. 
                Deforestation in the current scenario may have reduced however it would be too early to assume.
            </li>
            <li>3. Land skinned of its tree cover for urban settlements should be urged to plant trees in the vicinity and replace the cut trees. Also the cutting must  be replaced by  planting young trees to replace the older ones that were cut. 
                Trees are being planted under several initiatives every year, but they still don’t match the numbers of the ones we’ve already lost.
