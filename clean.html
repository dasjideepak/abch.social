            Cleanliness is of great importance in the prevention of many kinds of infections - infections of the gut, the skin, the eyes, the lungs, and the whole body. Personal cleanliness (or hygiene) and public cleanliness (or sanitation) are both important.
            Many common infections of the gut are spread from one person to another because of poor hygiene and poor sanitation. Germs and worms (or their eggs) are passed by the thousands in the stools or feces (shit) of infected persons. These are carried from the feces of one person to the mouth of another by dirty fingers or contaminated food or water. Diseases that are spread or transmitted from feces-to-mouth in this way, 
            include:
                    路 diarrhea and dysentery (caused by amebas and bacteria)
                    路 intestinal worms (several types)
                    路 hepatitis, typhoid fever, and cholera
                    路 certain other diseases, like polio, are sometimes spread this same way
            The way these infections are transmitted can be very direct.
