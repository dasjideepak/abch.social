        <p>A shocking 17.7 million children in India are out of school. Working in hazardous conditions, living on the street, braving hunger, poverty and violence, childhood for them has become an endless struggle to survive.

            But despite their circumstances, they have not stopped dreaming. Their dreams are as colourful as any other child’s and they have just as much potential to fulfil them. What they lack is a fair chance – an opportunity to go school, to hone their talents, to even have a happy and carefree childhood that every child deserves.
            
            The Mission Education programme of Smile Foundation which is an NGO in India identifies such out-of-school children from remote villages, tribal areas and urban slums, and provides them quality education. In addition to this, it also looks after their health, nutrition, and holistic development through participation in co-curricular activities.
            
            Last year, 30,000 children across 22 states of India were directly provided education through 261 Mission Education projects. Leaving behind their circumstances, these children took the first step towards a bright future. But if their education is not continued, they may drop out of school.
            
            We have made their education our mission. You too can support online to ensure that poverty doesn't stand in the way of a child's education. Support online and take them a step closer to their dreams.
            
            Join and help us in our efforts to put Every Child in School.
